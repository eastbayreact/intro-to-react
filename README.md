# Intro to React

## Workshop structure
This workshop is fairly free-form. We provide you with a sample app challenge as described below, and we'll be happy to help you if you get stuck at any point. Alternatively, if you've been working on another project or set of problems, you're also free to just work on that as well! We'll still be around for any questions you have, even if they're not about this sample app.

## Objective
Today, you will be focused on one singular objective: **Leave a YouTube comment using React.**

### Your goal is to build a mock-YouTube comment page in which we:

* Are able to push a "Like" button, and then we see a "Like" counter go up
* Are able to push a "Subscribe" button, and then we see a "Subscribe" counter go up
* Are able to write and leave comments

Right away, you're given a fairly minimal React app setup which isn't very functional at first. This is your starting point.

This app was written in such a way that you will have to explore core React features in order to finish the objective. You will have to know how to work with **JSX**, **props**, **state**, and **downwards data flow**. 

You'll notice that there is an `examples/` directory in this repository. The folders inside that directory correspond to versions of the app which come with pre-written code that already implement a feature. If you feel like you need a hint, or if you'd like to skip ahead, you can go ahead and run `yarn start` or `npm start` in one of those sample directories and see what's going on there.
